{12/9/21 edit: I think candlestatus needs live candle, so we can't go back in history to find
				if a candle was crazy or not. We would need to contruct it off the 1min chart and printStatement 
				to notify us that a 5minbar we're looking at is "crazy" or not.
				Another idea would be to plot on the 1min chart, but then that has to be somewhere on the screen, 
				which you are not actually using the 1min chart in your analysis.

{If candle is crazy then signify it.
	Crazy candle is a candle that moves it's full capacity(ATR) within 50% of that canlde life. 
	}
	
	
		
{ATR:
	1) normal built-in ATR. without custom time. May be able to get away with making session time only the day.
	2) Home-built ATR with custom time.
}

//CandleStatus

// TrueRange / AvgTrueRange
// Timespent / TotalTimeSpent .. = candlestatus

{truerange: 50, ATR:75,}

Vars:
	ATR(0),
	RangeCompared_to_normal(0);

ATR = avgtruerange(24);
RangeCompared_to_normal = iff(ATR<>0, Truerange/ATR, 1);

If RangeCompared_to_normal > 1 and candlestatus < 50 then 
begin

	plot1(close);
	print(date, "   ", time);
end;
